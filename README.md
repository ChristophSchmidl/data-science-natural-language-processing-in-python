# Data Science: Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python

This repository is based on the Udemy course called [Data Science: Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python](https://www.udemy.com/data-science-natural-language-processing-in-python). I took the examples and added some changes which seem to make more sense to me than the original solutions. The solutions in this repository have been implemented by using Jupyter Notebook with additional explanations on the side.

The Udemy course contains the following sections:

* Natural Language Processing - What is it used for?
